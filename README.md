# Binder (2019 Federal Reserve Code-A-Thon)

### Team's Right? Swipe Right.

One of the biggest hurdles for entrepreneurs in 2019 is linking together
with like-minded individuals who are interested in creating a successful
business. Binder aims to solve this issue and foster entrepreneurship
among self starters by bridging the gap between these two groups.

Binder does this by allowing startup owners to pitch
their idea to those with the skills they need to make their dreams
a reality. On the other side, those skilled individuals who are looking for new, unique
challenges then showcase their talents to prospective startup owners. If both
parties believe that they would be a good match then Binder brings them
together.
